# .NET 6 Redirector Middleware / RESTful API

This project is a proof of concept for both a Middleware component and an
accompanying RESTful API. The API is responsible for providing a redirect map,
while the Middleware is responsible for checking the current request URL
against the redirect map and taking appropriate action.
